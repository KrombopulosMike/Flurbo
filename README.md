![logo](https://github.com/KrombopulosMike/Flurbo/blob/master/flurbologosmall.png "flurbo")

Flurbo is a coin used as intergalactic space currecny for payment of services and items. Space guns, assasins, and even for an entire afternoon at Blips and Chitz!

# Features of Flurbo

Flurbocoin runs off of a blockchain, enabling you to transfer massive amounts of Flurbo to totally friendly space aliens. 

# Smart Contract

Smart contracts cut out the middle-man. Allowing us to maintain our currency free from the peeping eyes of those no good scums from the Galactic Federation as well as the Council of Ricks. 

# Gromflomites Love Flurbos

Gromflomites trade Flurbos for anything and everything. This is because the Flurbo has an algorythm directly tied to the genetic makeup of Gromflomites. They can't get enough flurbos!
